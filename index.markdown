## About CFEngine

[CFEngine](http://cfengine.com/) is the most mature and widely used
tool for comprehensive configuration management. It was first released
in 1993, and it has [evolved](https://cfengine.com/company) over the
years to address real needs in real systems, and to match the
technological evolutions that have taken place, such as virtualization
and cloud computing. CFEngine is fine-tuned to the features and design
that make it possible to automate very large numbers of systems in a
scalable and manageable way. CFEngine has been designed to be very
resource-efficient, and it can run on everything from embedded devices
and [smartphones](http://www.cfengine.com/demos/cfengine-android) to
supercomputers.

CFEngine 3 was released in 2008. With the new version came a complete
overhaul of its syntax and mode of operation, and many new features
such as Knowledge Management and support for virtual
environments. CFEngine 3 is different from many other automation
mechanisms in that you do not need to tell it what to do. Instead, you
specify the state in which you wish the system to be, and CFEngine
will automatically and iteratively decide the actions to take to reach
the desired state, or as close to it as possible. Underlying this
ability is a powerful theoretical model known as [Promise
Theory](http://research.iu.hio.no/promises.php), which was initially
developed for CFEngine 3, but which has also found other applications
in Computer Science and in other fields such as Economics and
Organization.
