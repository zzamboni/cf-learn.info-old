## About the book

CFEngine 3 is the most mature and widely used tool for comprehensive
configuration management, and [Learning CFEngine
3](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do) will help you in
getting up to speed with it. The main audience for this book is
experienced system administrators of null-to-medium expertise with
CFEngine, although more advanced CFEngine users will also find useful
snippets and techniques. Its goal is to guide you from installation to
advanced examples and concepts by using examples and techniques that
can be put to work straight away.

The book is currently in writing, and an [Early
Release](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do) version has
been published by O'Reilly. It contains the first four chapters of the
book, which cover all the basic concepts of CFEngine 3 and some more
advanced usage. You can use the discount code AUTHD to get 40% off the
print version, and 50% off the e-book version. The final version will
be available in early 2012.

Just like the book, this web site is an "Early Release". Much of the
content is still in progress, but at least the
[blog](http://blog.cf-learn.info/), the [forum](discussion.html) and
the [errata](http://oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920022022)
are working already. I encourage you to participate and provide
feedback, ideas and questions.

Thank you for visiting! I hope you
find it useful. Please let me know if you find anything broken or
missing, or if you have any comments or suggestions.

## About CFEngine

[CFEngine](http://cfengine.com/) is the most mature and widely used
tool for comprehensive configuration management. It was first released
in 1993, and it has [evolved](https://cfengine.com/company) over the
years to address real needs in real systems, and to match the
technological evolutions that have taken place, such as virtualization
and cloud computing. CFEngine is fine-tuned to the features and design
that make it possible to automate very large numbers of systems in a
scalable and manageable way. CFEngine has been designed to be very
resource-efficient, and it can run on everything from embedded devices
and [smartphones](http://www.cfengine.com/demos/cfengine-android) to
supercomputers.

CFEngine 3 was released in 2008. With the new version came a complete
overhaul of its syntax and mode of operation, and many new features
such as Knowledge Management and support for virtual
environments. CFEngine 3 is different from many other automation
mechanisms in that you do not need to tell it what to do. Instead, you
specify the state in which you wish the system to be, and CFEngine
will automatically and iteratively decide the actions to take to reach
the desired state, or as close to it as possible. Underlying this
ability is a powerful theoretical model known as [Promise
Theory](http://research.iu.hio.no/promises.php), which was initially
developed for CFEngine 3, but which has also found other applications
in Computer Science and in other fields such as Economics and
Organization.
