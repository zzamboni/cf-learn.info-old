<p>This website is devoted to
CFEngine and, in particular, to the new book
"<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do">Learning
CFEngine 3</a>", published by O'Reilly. The purpose of this site is to
provide information, links, resources and news about the book and its
content.</p>

<p>The book is currently in writing, and
an <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do">early
release</a> version has been published by O'Reilly. It contains the
first four chapters of the book, which cover all the basic concepts of
CFEngine 3 and some more advanced usage. If you purchase it now, you
can use the discount code AUTHD to get 40% off the print version, and
50% off the e-book version. The final version will be available in
early 2012.</p>

<p>Just like the book, this web site is an "Early Release". Much of
  the content is still in progress, but at least
  the <a href="http://blog.cf-learn.info/">blog</a>,
  the <a href="discussion.html">forum</a> and
  the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920022022">errata</a>
  are working already. I encourage you to participate and provide
  feedback, ideas and questions.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting! I hope you
find it useful. Please let me know if you find anything broken or
missing, or if you have any comments or suggestions.</p>
