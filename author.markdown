My name is Diego Zamboni, and I am the author of [Learning CFEngine
3](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do). I am a computer
scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin and overall geek. I work
at [CFEngine AS](http://cfengine.com/) as "Senior Security
Advisor". My role is to advocate the power and usefulness of CFEngine,
particularly in the security space. I am very interested in topics
related to computer security, virtualization, configuration management
and system automation.

During college I founded the first computer security team at UNAM
(Mexico's national university), which would grow to become [a much
larger organization](http://www.seguridad.unam.mx/), before moving to
the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D. at [Purdue
University](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) under the direction of
[Gene Spafford](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/). Upon finishing my
studies, my wife and I decided to go to Switzerland, where I worked as
a researcher in computer security at the [IBM Zurich Research
Lab](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/). After eight years there, we moved
back to Mexico in late 2009, where I worked for HP Enterprise Services
as a security consultant. I live in
[Quer&eacute;taro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quer%C3%A9taro,_Quer%C3%A9taro)
with my awesome wife and our two beautiful daughters.
