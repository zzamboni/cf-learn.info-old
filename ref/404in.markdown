I could not find anything in the documentation index about the term
you entered.

My index is limited (in particular it only searches section headers
in the reference manual), so it's possible it's missiing whatever you are
searching for (or you mistyped it).

You could try going to the <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/">Reference manual</a>
and searching for it over there directly, or try entering your search term again.
