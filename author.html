<p style="color: #333333; line-height: 2em;">My name is Diego Zamboni,
  and I am the author
  of <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do">Learning
      CFEngine 3</a></em>. I am a computer scientist, consultant,
  programmer, sysadmin and overall geek. I work
  at <a href="http://cfengine.com/">CFEngine</a> as "Senior Security
  Advisor". My role is to advocate the power and usefulness of
  CFEngine, particularly in the security space. I am very interested
  in topics related to computer security, virtualization,
  configuration management and system automation.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; line-height: 2em;">During college I founded
  the first computer security team at UNAM (Mexico's national
  university), which would grow to
  become <a href="http://www.seguridad.unam.mx/"
            style="text-decoration: none; color: #0000ff;">a much
    larger organization</a>, before moving to the U.S. to pursue my
  Ph.D. at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/"
              style="text-decoration: none; color: #0000ff;">Purdue
    University</a> under the direction
  of <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/65"
        style="text-decoration: none; color: #0000ff;">Gene
    Spafford</a>. Upon finishing my studies, my wife and I decided to
  go to Switzerland, where I worked as a researcher in computer
  security at the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/"
                     style="text-decoration: none; color:
                            #0000ff;">IBM Zurich Research
    Lab</a>. After eight years there, we moved back to Mexico in late
  2009, where I worked for HP Enterprise Services as a security
  consultant. I live
  in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quer%C3%A9taro,_Quer%C3%A9taro"
        style="text-decoration: none; color: #0000ff;">Quer√©taro</a>
  with my awesome wife and our two beautiful daughters.</p>
